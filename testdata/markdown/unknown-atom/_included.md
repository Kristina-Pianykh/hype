<aside>
Modules are built into the heart of Go's toolchain, and are used to build and manage Go packages. Commands such as `go build`, `go test`, and `go get` have been written to work with modules. As a result the process of working with modules is transparent to the user.

When, however, you need to work with modules directly, you can use the `go mod` command to interact with them. The `go mod` command has a number of sub-commands that can be useful for managing modules.
