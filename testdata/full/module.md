# Interfaces and Generics

Interfaces in Go provide a way to specify the behavior of an object; "If something can do this, then it can be used here". In this {{.Ident}} we will look at how to use interfaces to abstract behavior. Later in this {{.Ident}} we will learn how Generics can be used to further refine interfaces. Concepts such as the `Empty Interface`, satisfying multiple interfaces, value vs. pointer receivers, and asserting for behavior will be covered in this {{.Ident}}.
